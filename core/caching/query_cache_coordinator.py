"""L1 (in-process) cache + single-flight coalescing in front of the
existing L2 (PostgreSQL) query result cache.

Why this exists (roadmap sections 3 and 6): before this module, every
single request -- including N *identical* concurrent requests for the
same not-yet-cached query -- independently hit the L2 cache (a
service-database read, plus a synchronous access-stat write on every
hit) and, on a miss, independently executed the same query against the
warehouse connection pool. Under a burst of duplicate traffic (the
exact shape of the load test: 500 concurrent identical `SELECT 1`s)
that means 500 service-database reads and up to 500 redundant
warehouse executions competing for a pool of 10 connections, when one
execution would have satisfied all 500 callers.

This coordinator fixes both problems:

    - L1: a small in-process TTL/LRU cache (`core.db.cache.HybridQueryCache`)
      checked first, with no I/O at all on a hit -- not even a thread
      hop.
    - Single-flight: if N callers ask for the same cache key at the
      same time and it isn't in L1, only the first ("leader") actually
      checks L2 / executes the query; the rest ("followers") await the
      leader's in-flight `asyncio.Future` and get the same result
      without touching the database at all.

Cache-hit traffic never triggers a synchronous write: an L2 hit's
access-stat bookkeeping is scheduled via the bounded cache-persistence
queue (`core.caching.persistence_queue`) onto the background executor,
not awaited inline (roadmap rule #3) and not an unbounded
fire-and-forget task (roadmap Phase 10).
