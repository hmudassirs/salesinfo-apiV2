"""Application lifecycle management for sync and async contexts.

Design
------
ApplicationLifespan owns:
    - startup/shutdown sequencing
    - container registration
    - lifecycle state (what has started, in what order)

It does NOT own:
    - how to connect to a given database
    - what tables to create
    - what SQL to run

Each subsystem (data warehouse, service database, ...) is a small
`LifecycleStep`. A step knows how to start and stop *itself* and returns
the objects that should be registered in the container. ApplicationLifespan
just iterates the list of steps in order on startup, and in reverse order
on shutdown. Adding a new subsystem means adding one LifecycleStep to the
list below — there's no second place to remember to wire it up, which is
what caused the container-registration and shutdown bugs in the previous
version (a subsystem was connected but its shutdown/registration logic
lived somewhere else and got missed).

    Registers the process-wide default registry so
    `install_performance_middleware`/`install_performance_dashboard`
    (installed on the app in `core.app.api.app.create_app`) and this
    step agree on which registry they're both touching, without either
    one having to construct or pass one around explicitly.

    Disabled by default, matching `PerformanceConfig`'s own
    fail-safe-disabled philosophy: with `PERF_ENABLED` unset, this step
    still registers the (empty, inert) registry but starts no
    background work. The collector scheduler and the OTel export loop
    only ever run in async mode — sync mode (e.g. `LifecycleMode.SYNC`,
    used by tests and scripts) has no running event loop to host them
    on, the same constraint `ServiceDatabaseStep` documents for
    ServiceDatabase's psycopg2 connections.

    OTel export: `core.performance.exporters.otel_exporter.OTelExporter`
    turns the registry's current counters/gauges/histograms into OTel
    metric instruments on every call to `.export()`, but nothing used to
    call it on any schedule — it sat unused in the codebase. This step
    now runs it every `PERF_OTEL_EXPORT_INTERVAL_SECONDS` (default 15s)
    for the lifetime of the app, so request/DB/pool/auth timings and
    resource-collector samples flow through the same OTLP pipeline
    `core.observability.otel.OpenTelemetryManager` already pushes traces
    (and its own db/cache metrics) through. `OTelExporter` reads the
    global meter via `opentelemetry.metrics.get_meter(...)`, so it picks
    up whatever `MeterProvider` `get_otel_manager()` configured in
    `ApplicationLifespan.__init__` below — that call happens first, so
    the provider is already in place by the time this step starts.
    Controlled by `PERF_EXPORT_OTEL` (defaults on whenever the
