"""Central, in-process owner of aggregation, collectors, and exporters.

`PerformanceRegistry` is where the "Trace/Event -> Collector -> Registry
-> Aggregator -> Exporter" pipeline from `docs/PerformancePlan.md` is
wired together. It is intentionally the only stateful, shared object in
the subsystem: everything upstream of it (`PerformanceTimer`, `Trace`,
`RequestProfiler`) is request-local and lock-free, and everything
downstream (`Collector`, `Exporter`) is optional and pulls from it rather
than being pushed to synchronously on the request path.

`record_completed_request` is the one method called from (the end of) a
request. It only appends to a bounded, GIL-protected `deque` and folds
already-computed points into the aggregator's in-memory dicts — no I/O,
no exporter call, no lock. Collectors and exporters read from the
registry later, out of band.
