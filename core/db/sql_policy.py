"""SQL statement classification for authorization and concurrency control.

Two independent classifications, both purely textual (no real SQL
parser dependency was already present in this codebase, and adding one
is out of scope for this pass -- these heuristics are deliberately
conservative: anything ambiguous is classified as the *more*
restrictive/expensive option rather than the more permissive one):

- `classify_operation()` -- roadmap Phase 13.1 ("read-only query API"
  vs "full DB console" decision). This deployment chose "DB console
  with scope-gated writes" -- see AppSettings.require_write_scope_for_mutations
  for the reasoning. SELECT/WITH is "read" *only* when no DML/DDL
  keyword appears anywhere in the statement (see the writable-CTE note
  below); everything else -- INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, DDL, or anything
  unrecognized -- is "write", so an unrecognized statement is never
  accidentally treated as safe-to-run-unscoped.

- `classify_cost()` -- roadmap Phase 14. A rough FAST/NORMAL/EXPENSIVE
  bucket used only to pick which concurrency semaphore a query waits
  on before reaching the DB pool; it is not a query planner and makes
  no claim about actual execution cost. Being wrong just means a query
  waits on a different semaphore than ideal, not an incorrect result.
