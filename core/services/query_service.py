classification/concurrency gating, cache lookup (L1 -> single-flight ->

invalidation on writes.

Pulled out of the route handler (roadmap P0-9: "routes should be thin
request/response translation, not where caching/pooling/execution
policy lives") so `core/app/api/routes/query.py` only has to decode the
