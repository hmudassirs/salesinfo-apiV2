"""Composition root wiring the domain repositories/services together
around one shared ServiceDatabase connection.

This file intentionally contains no business logic of its own — it is
the one place that knows every domain service exists and hands them
out as attributes (service_manager.api_keys, .users, .logging, ...).
Each individual service now lives with its own domain (auth/,
observability/, caching/) instead of all six being defined in one
`service_manager.py`, which is what made this hard to navigate before.
