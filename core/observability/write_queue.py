"""Background flush queue for request observability writes.

Batching 4 writes into 1 transaction per request (see
core/observability/context.py) cut the *overhead per write*, but each
request still needed its own round trip through the service database's
connection pool -- under N concurrent requests, that's N separate pool
checkouts and N separate commits purely for logging/tracing/audit, all
competing with everything else for a pooled connection and adding their
own commit latency (each `COMMIT` is a round trip to Postgres, fsync
included) directly to the request.

This queue removes the write from the request path entirely: producers
(emit_request_observability) just enqueue a record — fast, in-memory,
no I/O — and a single background thread drains the queue periodically,
writing many requests' worth of records in ONE transaction. Response
latency stops being coupled to how many *other* requests also need to
log something, and to how busy the service-database pool happens to be.

Trade-off, stated plainly: if the process dies with records still
queued, those log/trace/audit entries are lost. For request
logging/tracing/audit — not the actual data warehouse — that's normally
an acceptable trade for the latency win. Reconsider if you need these
records durable synchronously with the response (e.g. audit entries
required for compliance before an action is considered "complete" —
in that case, write those specific ones synchronously and queue only
the rest).
