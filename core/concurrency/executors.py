"""Dedicated, bounded thread pools for blocking I/O -- one per workload.

Why this exists (roadmap rule #5: "Do not use one oversized global
thread pool for unrelated workloads."):

Before this module, every blocking call in the process -- application
data queries, state-store reads/writes (auth lookups, query cache
reads/writes, logging), and fire-and-forget background writes -- all
went through `asyncio.to_thread`, which dispatches into the event
loop's single *default* executor. That means a burst of slow application
data queries can starve API-key validation, or a wave of cache-hit access-
stat writes can delay someone else's actual query execution, purely
because they're all fighting over the same finite thread pool with no
relationship to each other's workload.

This module instead gives each workload its own bounded
`ThreadPoolExecutor`:

    - `application_data_executor`: application data reads/writes (the main query path)
    - `application_state_executor`: the application state store (auth, API keys, query
      result cache reads/writes) -- a separate PostgreSQL connection
      pool from the application data's, even though both point at the same
      database (see core.storage.application_state_store's module docstring)
    - `background_executor`: fire-and-forget work that must never
      compete with request-serving threads for a slot -- cache
      persistence after a miss, access-stat bookkeeping on a cache hit,
      observability flushes

Sizing: each executor's `max_workers` should track the *matching*
connection pool's `max_size` (there's no point in more threads than
there are connections to use them with), plus a little headroom for
in-flight bookkeeping. `configure_executors()` is called once at
startup with the real pool sizes; the defaults here exist only so
importing this module without configuring it still works (e.g. in
tests).
