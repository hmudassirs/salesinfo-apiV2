"""Create (or promote) the first admin user, outside the HTTP API —
and issue them an API key, since nothing in this system can do that
for them otherwise.

Why this exists
----------------
`register_user` always creates a plain "user" account, and the only way
to grant admin is `PATCH /api/auth/users/{user_id}/role` — which itself
requires an existing admin's API key. That's correct for every user
*after* the first, but it leaves a chicken-and-egg problem for the very
first admin the system ever has. This script is the deliberate, narrow
escape hatch: it talks to the application state store directly, run by whoever
has shell/deploy access to the box — not by anyone over the network.

There is a second, easy-to-miss chicken-and-egg problem underneath the
first one: the API-key middleware in app.py only ever validates API
keys (`x-api-key` header, checked against the `api_keys` table) — it
never validates the JWT that `/api/auth/users/login` returns. So even a
freshly bootstrapped admin, with a real username/password and a JWT
from logging in, still cannot call `POST /api/auth/keys` (the only way
to obtain a key) because that endpoint sits behind the same
API-key-only middleware. Creating the user is not enough; this script
also has to mint their first API key directly against the service
database, the same way it mints their first user record.

Usage
-----
Run from anywhere — this script locates the project root itself:

    python scripts/bootstrap_admin.py --username admin --email admin@example.com
    python scripts/bootstrap_admin.py --username admin --email admin@example.com --promote-existing

By default this also prints a freshly issued API key for the account —
the only time it will ever be shown. Pass --skip-api-key if you already
have a valid key for this account and don't want to mint another one.

If --password is omitted, you'll be prompted (input hidden, not echoed
to the terminal, not stored in shell history). You can also set it via
the ADMIN_BOOTSTRAP_PASSWORD environment variable for non-interactive
use (e.g. a container entrypoint) — prefer piping it in over passing
--password on the command line, since command-line args are visible to
other processes on the same machine (`ps`, /proc).

Safety properties
------------------
- Refuses to create a duplicate username; use --promote-existing to
  instead call update_role() on an already-registered account.
- Reuses UserCreate's pydantic validation (min password length, etc.)
  so this script can't create an account the API itself would reject.
- Uses the same core.auth.passwords.hash_password the API uses, so
  there's exactly one password-hashing implementation in the codebase.
- Issues API keys through the same core.auth.api_key_service.APIKeyService
  the HTTP API uses (generation, hashing, storage) — one implementation,
  not a second copy that could quietly drift from it.
- Never prints the password or its hash back to the terminal or logs.
  The raw API key is the one secret this script does print, since
  there is no other way to retrieve it later — the API itself only
  ever returns it once, at creation time, same as here.
